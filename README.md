# MSCI-436-Final-Project

## Introduction
Our end user is a landscaping company seeking to launch an advertising campaign in a specific neighborhood in Ames, Iowa.

Our objective for this campaign is to analyze various characteristics of houses in that neighborhood in order to anticipate the impact or potential increase in their value.

We will examine the correlations between specific house characteristics and their corresponding prices. This analysis will help us determine whether services offered by our landscaping company, such as adding a fireplace or improving basement finishing, have the potential to enhance the value of a house.

## Data
For this project we used the ["House Prices"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) dataset found on Kaggle.

## The User Interface 
We designed our user interface with the end user as the focal point. As we developed this regression model for the landscaping company, our primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface that the company could utilize as an effective marketing tool.
